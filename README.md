MAKING OF 4 LEGGED ROBOT :--

1. First a fall we studied onramps of Simulink and Matlab, when we will use sensors in our robot then the data we will be collecting from those sensors, those data can be graphed ,analysed, manipulated and different maathematical operations can be performed in Simulink and Matlab also taking help of other MATHWORK tools.
2. Installed ros noetic, ubanto, gazebo, RVIZ
3. Learned to use the below link and using it to run RVIZ, Telecop node, Gmapping, and Gazebo:-
         https://github.com/chvmp/champ.git
4. Learned to make a new gazebo and installing a robot into it by changing the code of "gazebo.launch" of our animal_discription file.
5. Learned to make Robotic arm using MOVEIT software  : --
